Feature: Room reservation validation

    As a guest
    I want clear feedback when required details are missing
    So that I can correct the reservation form

    Scenario: Required guest details are validated
        Given the guest opens the Shady Meadows booking site
        When the guest searches for the displayed one-night stay
        And opens the first available room
        And starts the reservation
        And submits the guest details form without entering details
        Then booking validation errors should be displayed
